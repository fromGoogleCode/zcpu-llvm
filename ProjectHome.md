This project aims to create a backend for LLVM that targets the ZyeliosCPU, which is the CPU entity in the Wiremod project for Garry's Mod.

The repo currently contains a branch of llvm-2.6 which includes our code. Right now, the code is in only a partially completed state and is currently not working. You have been warned.
